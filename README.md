# Smart Traffic Light System Using BASYS 3 FPGA ðŸš¦

This project showcases a **smart traffic management system** built using the **BASYS 3 FPGA board**. Designed to optimize safety and efficiency at busy highway intersections, the system combines modern technology with intelligent design to handle real-world challenges in traffic control.

At its core, the system manages a **4-street intersection** with **2 lanes per street**, coordinating both vehicle and pedestrian traffic. Using **VHDL programming**, the FPGA board controls the flow of traffic, responds to violations, and incorporates environmental monitoringâ€”all while maintaining the high precision and reliability required for such systems.

## What Makes It Smart?

1. **Integrated Sensors**: Detect vehicles crossing during a red light and trigger alarms to ensure compliance with traffic rules.  
2. **Environmental Awareness**: Measure the ambient temperature and display it on the BASYS 3 board, bringing additional context to the system.  
3. **Realistic Operation**: Control high-voltage **220V LEDs**, replicating the functionality of real-world traffic lights.

## Designed for Versatility ðŸš¦ðŸ‘Ÿ

Each street is equipped with:
- **Traffic lights for vehicles** to manage flow efficiently.  
- **Pedestrian signals** to ensure safety at crossings.
